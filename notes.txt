Goal - investigate relationship between two factors
     1) relative bargaining power of the two agents = 0 < m < 1
     2) probability of bargaining failure = 0 < p < 1
     and Ua.

2 teams - a and u (aligned & unaligned)

Actions - each team can convert some proportion of N into X and some into Y.
Proportion of N that a spends on X = 0 < Aa < 1
Proportion of N that u spends on X = 0 < Au < 1
N = 10^22

Ua = m * slog(N * Aa) + (1 - m) * slog(N * Au)
Uu = m * slog(N * (1 - Aa)) + (1 - m) * slog(N * (1 - Au))

Bargaining succeeds = action profile maximizes (Ua - Uamin) * (Uu - Uumin) (or some other bargaining solution / social welfare function)
Bargaining fails = action profile results in Uamin, Uumin. 3 different schenarios:
	   1) Aa = 1, Au = 0
	   2) Ua = 0, Uu = 0
	   3) like (1), but utilities are swapped and -'ed.

dUp(p, m) = Ua(p(1 + delta), m) - Ua(p, m)
dUm(p, m) = Ua(p, m(1 + delta)) - Ua(p, m)

3 heatmaps -
  y-axis = p (log scale), limits specified in doc
  x-axis = m (log scale), limits specified in doc
  1) default (what does that mean?) expected Ua given p.
  2) (difference in Ua due to 1% change in p/(1-p)) / (" m/(1-m)) == (dUp / dUm) (colours specified in doc)
  3) max(dUp, dUm) (colours should represent which is bigger.

toggles:
	* resolution of heat maps
	* N
	* log axes, axes range
	* social welfare function being optimized
	* bargaining failure schenaro (define function so a new one can be implemented easily)
	* % change in p/(1-p) and m/(1-m) 'delta'

sanity checks:
     * expected payoff of A should increase with increasing m
     * expected payoff of both A and U should increase with increasing p
